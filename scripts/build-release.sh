#
# Builds the four release assets, callmeter_{version}_{os}_{arch} for linux and
# darwin on amd64 and arm64, into DIR (default dist/) and writes DIR/SHA256SUMS,
# one `{sha256}  {asset}` line per asset, sorted by asset. The build is
# reproducible: the same sources and toolchain give the same bytes in any
# directory. --write-sums also copies the sums to
# plugins/callmeter/libexec/SHA256SUMS, the file the wrapper verifies against.
#
# The version is plugin.json's. The build refuses any Go toolchain but the
# pinned one: a different compiler yields different bytes, so sums committed
# from it would never match CI's.
